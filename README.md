# Data Scientist Survival Guide

Hi there!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and thanks for dropping by the Data Science Survival Guide!

My goal is to document and curate the learnings, resources and code that helped me build a career in data science and machine learning.
As someone that took the long-ish windy path to developing their career, I understand how frustrating and noisy the data science space is (and the influencers too!). I hope to make your data science journey a little easier by pulling together the resoures I used (and approve).

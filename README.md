# 100 Days of Data Science

Hi!

My name is Mikiko Bazeley and this is my repo for my project: 100 Days of Data Science. 


For more information about my Springboard work: All of the documentation, code, and notes can be found [here](https://github.com/MMBazel/springboard-program), as well as links to other resources I found helpful for successfully completing the program. 

For questions or comments, please feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikikobazeley/). 

Goal:

* First 30 days - Statistics, experiemtnation, hypothesis testing, sampling etc using python + EDA (including visualization)
+ Active learning through exercises, tests, projects

** Statistics, experiemtnation, hypothesis testing, sampling etc using python + EDA (including visualization)

** Basic data gathering, connecting

** Using statistical python libraries

** Basic IDE, etc


* Days 31 - 60 - Basic machine learning (supervised + unsupervised, algorithms) 
+ Active learning through exercises, tests, projects

** Feature engineering

** Feature Exploration

** Interpretability

** Parameter tuning

** Software coding/engineering



* Days 61 - 90 - Advanced machine learning (NLP, Deep Learning)  + Advanced mathematics + DS at Scale
+Active learning + Projects + Technical inerview prep

** Productionalizing models

** Software engineering (advanced)

** NLP/Deep Learning Packages

** Recommendation Systems
